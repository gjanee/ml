# Data preprocessing:
#
# instruction-stats-raw.csv => our-workshops-preliminary.csv
#
# Goal: select workshops for general audiences, mostly RDS and DREAM
# Lab workshops, for which scheduling and instruction modality were
# decisions on our part.  Therefore, excluded are drop-ins and other
# sessions that were for a particular class, where the time was
# dictated by the class or faculty member and the audience was given
# and required to attend (e.g., RCR trainings).
#
# Workshops to be excluded are identified primarily by having a
# non-null `Faculty or Instructor` field.  This test is not perfect:
# due to data entry errors, for some workshops the librarian's name
# was entered as the faculty member, causing them to be excluded by
# the preceding logic, but this doesn't significantly affect the
# identification of relevant RDS and DREAM Lab workshops.
#
# Workshops are further filtered to include only those where `Course
# department` is "Carpentry Workshop" or "OTHER (e.g. non-course
# integrated instruction)".  Doing so excludes a few workshops that
# could conceivably be included in this analysis such as Zotero
# workshops offered by Research & Engagement.  Still included (perhaps
# undesirably so) are workshops that are part of a larger event such
# as Love Data Week, where the scheduling was not a free decision.
#
# N.B.: The raw data appears to list workshops multiple times, one row
# per instructor, hence the need to collapse using `distinct`.
