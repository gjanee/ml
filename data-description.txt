week_in_quarter
    Normalized week in quarter of first workshop date, computed using
    logic borrowed from the Waitz Shiny application.
        - Quarter weeks start on Sunday.  Thus, regardless of which
          day of the week the first day of a quarter falls on, it is
          in week 1, and the following Monday is in week 2.
        - Quarters are adjusted to have the same length.  (All
          quarters have the same number of teaching days, but due to
          holidays, Fall quarters have 4 extra days and are 1 week
          longer than Winter and Spring quarters.)  For Fall quarters,
          we exclude the week containing Thanksgiving.  In this way
          all quarters have exactly 11 weeks, and weeks 10 and 11 are
          always dead week and finals week, respectively.
    For our purposes here, a workshop that took place outside a
    quarter, i.e. during a break, is treated as belonging to the
    previous quarter, hence quarter week numbers may be greater than
    11.
